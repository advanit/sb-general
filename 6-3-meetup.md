# Brief Discussion

The goal for the meetup was to observe and explore what the GDG had to offer analytically.  Recently, Google has made progress in analytics domain by creating analytical tools.  They include Google Data Studio, Google Data Explorer, and BigQuery.  Also, this was to check out how the community was using Google's products.  They had two sections: one for hacking, another for talks.  I stayed for both. 

The event focused on a new IoT platform called Android Things.  This was to integrate Android's software onto the Raspberry Pi, Rainbow Hat, etc.  My focus was on analytics, so the event organizer Nitya was kind to direct me to Google CodeLabs, where they had a lot of stuff.  See directed to one lab focused on Analytics.  Also, she talked about a conference called JupyterCon happening in NY and a day workshop on Google's BigQuery and Big Data, happening in late September.  At the end, I looked around Codelabs to work on a simple activity using TensorFlow.  The code lab was called "Tensorflow for Poets."  This was a simple machine learning exercise.  This installed Docker (which I don't know what it does), Tensorflow, and Python.  It was to take a series of photos, create an algorithm that made it learn, and identify what type of plant or what it was near based on training and testing.  It was an interesting lab, though I had an issue at the end.  

As for the talk if interested, the talk was on creating a robo-car.  This leveraged computer vision, a few materials that cost $100, and Android Things.  The links for the presentation are below too, and I found this interesting because of my EE background.  But in regards to data science, the Tensorflow tutorial was a good starting point for me.  They have several other tutorials right now, but I'll refrain from pursuit.
